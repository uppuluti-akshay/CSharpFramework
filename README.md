# CSharpFramework

Welcome to the CSharpUIAutomation Framework with SpecFlow, Selenium, and MSTest! This project is designed to provide a comprehensive and scalable solution for automating UI test cases using C#, SpecFlow, Selenium, and MSTest. SpecFlow facilitates Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) by allowing you to write tests in a human-readable format. Selenium WebDriver is leveraged for robust browser automation, and MSTest serves as the test runner, seamlessly integrating with Visual Studio.

**Key Features**
1.	Behavior-Driven Development (BDD): Utilize Gherkin syntax to write clear and understandable tests that bridge the gap between technical and non-technical team 
    members.
2.	Selenium WebDriver Integration: Automate browser interactions across multiple platforms and browsers, ensuring comprehensive test coverage.
3.	MSTest Integration: Execute tests using MSTest, benefiting from its detailed reporting and integration with Visual Studio.
4.	Modular Architecture: The framework is designed with modularity in mind, promoting maintainability and scalability.
5.	Cross-Browser Testing: Ensure your application performs consistently across different browsers.
6.	Extensibility: Easily extend the framework with custom step definitions, hooks, and utility functions.


**Getting Started**
To get started with this framework, follow these steps:
1.	Clone the Repository:
2.	git clone https://github.com/uppuluti-akshay/CSharpFramework.git
3.	Install Dependencies: Use NuGet to install SpecFlow, Selenium WebDriver, MSTest, and other necessary packages.
4.	Configure the Framework: Update the configuration files to align with your application's requirements.
5.	Write Your Tests:
•	Create feature files using Gherkin syntax.
•	Implement step definitions in C#.
•	Use Selenium WebDriver for browser interactions.
6.	Run the Tests: Execute the tests using MSTest. You can run the tests directly from Visual Studio or via the command line.
